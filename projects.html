					<b>Text Analysis & Infographics of H. P. Lovecraft's Fiction</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					H. P. Lovecraft is my favorite fiction author. I have memorized several of his short stories and when I'm feeling some poetic motivation, I will usually go for his cosmic horror style. I love his imagery and the psychological bend on the horror of his stories. Here is a great sentence from "Celephais":
				</p>
				<p>
					"The abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations."
				</p>
				<p>
					I love it! I had a couple goals for this project: to explore the relationship between his fiction works, to absorb some of his style of imagery via word choice and combinations of descriptive words, and to generate new text in a Lovecraftian style.
				</p>
				<p>
					Others have worked on this project before: the dataset is available on Kaggle (though I scraped it from a site dedicated to him). A Lovecraftian text generator is a project I found on Kaggle. These are not new. I googled around for Lovecraft infographics on his texts and didn't find any. I believe the infographics I (plan to) create will be some of the first. I also bring in supplemental data to aid in the analysis. At this point just a dictionary api to help identify phrases.

					<b>Kaggle Credit Card Fraud</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					I repeat what many have done before for my own knowledge.

					<b>VAST 2017 dataset</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					I found this dataset in college and played with it a little. The dataset is from a competition for visualization. More to come.

				<p>I'm working on this website in order to move from my current position to a position as a Data Scientist. I love Williams Sonoma: the people and the product. But who knows where life will take me...</p>
