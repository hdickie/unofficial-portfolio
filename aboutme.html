		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p><b>Intro</b><br />In the time I have spent at Williams Sonoma, first as a Data analyst and more recently as a Business Systems Analyst, I have become familiar with digital and print marketing, writing technical requirements for marketing projects (with IT as the intended audience) and continuous business optimization workflow. My immediate team focused on data governance for marketing, with a focus on legal compliance, UAT for newly developed changes and assisting production support by providing documentation, pulling and transferring data, and developing and optimizing queries.</p>
		<p>I like to read and cook and work out. Iâ€™m passionate about organization and making plans, machine learning, computer graphics and information security. I love San Francisco: going to restaurants and discovering foods I love and trying to recreate them at home is one of my favorite things to do. I also love bubble baths, sparkling water and sunshine. If time and money were irrelevant, I would probably spend my time reading, writing, making digital art, and developing my own smallish video games where I write the story, make the graphics, publish and care for it. My favorite indie video game is To the Moon.</p>

		<b>Education</b>
		<br />
		I graduated from University of San Francisco in 2017 with a BS in Data Science. It is important to note that most data science programs are at the graduate level, and this one was not. It gave me an excellent foundation that I hae built upon through independent study in the years since, and have developed a data science competence that I demonstrate through this portfolio.
